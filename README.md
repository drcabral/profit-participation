# Profit Participation Exercise

This repository contains a reviewed code of an exercise, developed with Java with OOD in mind.

"The company XYZ needs an application that calculates, through a few inputs, the total value of profit participation of an employee, following these rules:

1. The information needs to be written and read by the console, initially.
2. The user needs to start the application informing two important values: the number of employees of the company and its profit for the year. These values must be saved in the memory to calculate the questions that come after.
3. After step 2, the user can ask about the total value of profit participation through an occupation and the annual performance of the employee.
4. The occupation can be: Trainee, Analyst and Manager.
5. The annual performance can vary from 1 to 5.
6. The value is directly proportional to the employee performance and a multiplication that each occupation has. Trainee multiplication is by 1, analyst is by 2 and manager is by 3.
7. The company will only offer profit participation for its employees if your total profit is more than R$ 10,000 x number of employees.
8. The calculation of the final profit participation is made using the following rules: (employee performance) x (occupation multiplication) x (40% of total profit / total number of employees)."
